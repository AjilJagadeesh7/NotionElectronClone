# Unofficial Notion Electron App (ENotionClone)🚀

Hey there, welcome to Unoffical Notion Electron App! (ENotionClone)🎉

## What's This?

This is an Electron application that brings Notion to Linux! 🌟 Since the official Notion app isn't available for Linux (bummer, right?), I decided to roll up my sleeves and create this nifty app to give us Linux enthusiasts a taste of Notion's awesomeness on our favorite OS.
Basically loads the webpage inside the electron app.

Getting started is a piece of cake:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Build using electron builder  ```npx electron-builder --mac --win --linux```    

## Contribution 🙌

I'd absolutely love your contribution! Whether it's fixing a bug, enhancing features, or suggesting improvements, let's make this ENotionClone experience even better together! Here's how you can contribute:
- Fork the repo.
- Make your changes.
- Submit a pull request.

## Credits 🙏
Massive thanks to the Electron wizards and the Notion community for the inspiration and support! 🌟
